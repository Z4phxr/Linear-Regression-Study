# Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression Study and Model Building

This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of linear, ridge, and lasso regression. It includes:

* A study of the linear, ridge, and lasso regression concepts and their mathematical foundations.  
* Implementation and training of linear, ridge, and lasso regression models using Python.  
* Building a custom linear regression model from scratch to deepen understanding.  
* Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.  

The goal of this notebook is to gain hands-on experience with linear, ridge, and lasso regression both through existing libraries and custom implementations, enhancing practical and theoretical knowledge in machine learning.
