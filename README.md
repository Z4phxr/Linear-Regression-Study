# Linear Regression Study and Model Building

This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to exploring the fundamentals of linear regression. It includes:

- A study of the linear regression concept and its mathematical foundations.
- Implementation and training of a linear regression model using Python.
- Building a custom linear regression model from scratch to deepen understanding.
- Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.

The goal of this notebook is to gain hands-on experience with linear regression both through existing libraries and custom implementations, enhancing practical and theoretical knowledge in machine learning.
